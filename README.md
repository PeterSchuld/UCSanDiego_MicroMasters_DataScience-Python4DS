UCSanDiegoX: DSE200x: Learn to use powerful, open-source, Python tools, including Pandas, Git and Matplotlib, to manipulate, analyze, and visualize complex datasets. Instructors: Ilkay Altintas, Chief Data Science Officer, San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) Leo Porter, Assistant Teaching Professor, Computer Science and Engineering, UC San Diego

Final Project: We use Pandas, Matplotlib and World bank data to analyse CO2 emission trends worldwide.

Abstract: Early stage economic development depends on increasing CO2 emission-per-capita unless cheap and reliable alternatives to
fossil fuel energy sources like coal are widely available. China’s produces 2/3 of its electricity with coal and her strong
economic growth since the mid-1960’s is accompanied by accelerating CO2-per-capita growth up to levels of advanced European
economies. France has shown a similar fossil fuel growth dependence in the 1960’s until she switched to nuclear power generation in
the 1970’s and 1980’s. Since that change to alternative (i.e. non-fossil) energy sources for electricity generation her impressive
economic growth decoupled from the reliance on ever increasing CO2-emissions. The example of France shows that access to cheap and
reliable electric energy is the key ingredient for economic growth. Technological advancements in renewable energy sources like
wind and solar should enable other developed economies and emerging economies to achieve sustainable economic growth while reducing
CO2-emissions.
