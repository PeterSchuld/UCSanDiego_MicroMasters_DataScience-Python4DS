#### Final Project: We use Pandas, Matplotlib and World Bank data to analyse CO2 emission trends worldwide ####

Early stage economic development depends on increasing CO2 emission-per-capita unless cheap and reliable alternatives to
fossil fuel energy sources like coal are widely available. China’s produces 2/3 of its electricity with coal and her strong
economic growth since the mid-1960’s is accompanied by accelerating CO2-per-capita growth up to levels of advanced European
economies. France has shown a similar fossil fuel growth dependence in the 1960’s until she switched to nuclear power generation in
the 1970’s and 1980’s. Since that change to alternative (i.e. non-fossil) energy sources for electricity generation her impressive
economic growth decoupled from the reliance on ever increasing CO2-emissions. The example of France shows that access to cheap and
reliable electric energy is the key ingredient for economic growth. Technological advancements in renewable energy sources like
wind and solar should enable other developed economies and emerging economies to achieve sustainable economic growth while reducing
CO2-emissions. 

#### Course Outline ####

The course is broken into 10 weeks.  The beginning of the course is heavily focused on learning the basic tools of data science, but we firmly believe that you learn the most about data science by doing data science.  So the latter half of the course is a combination of working on large projects and introductions to advanced data analysis techniques.

    Week 1 - Introduction:  The data science process and the value of learning data science.
    Week 2 - Background:  We provide a brief background in python and unix to get you up and running.  
    Week 3 - Jupyter and Numpy  
    Week 4 - Pandas:  Pandas, data frames offer critical data analysis functionality and features.
    Week 5 - Visualization:  you'll often wish to use visualizations to present your results.
    Week 6 - Mini Project:   Pick a dataset and perform an analysis for this first project.
    Week 7 - Machine Learning:  how to use sci-kit learn - a powerful library for machine learning.
    Week 8 - Working with Text and Databases:  analyze text data using Natural Language Processing.
    Week 9 - Final Project
    Week 10- Final Project
